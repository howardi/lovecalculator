    <p>Now we want to build a love calculator that will give us how many percent match are 2 partners
    
    Build a love Calculator that takes 2 name inputs, then generate a random number that tells us if they are match
    i.e firstinput = John, secondinput = Mary, then return:
    John and Mary are 75% match!!
    
    
    Note: 75% is the random number generated, if i rerun the program with the same name it should give me a different
    percentage, and also your random number should from 0% to 100%
    And also this is not a real love calculator, it won't give you a real result, don't test this with your partners
    "Laugh."
    Thanks and GoodLuck!</p>
